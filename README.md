This repository contains a simple portfolio page and a basic Python script for "humanizing" text.

## humanizer.py

`humanizer.py` is a small command-line tool that takes formal text and replaces certain words with more casual alternatives. It can also sprinkle filler phrases to make sentences sound slightly more conversational.

### Usage

```bash
python3 humanizer.py "However, we will utilize numerous methods."
```

The script will output something similar to:

```
But, we will use many methods. maybe
```

Each run may produce a slightly different result because filler phrases are chosen randomly.
